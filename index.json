My goal is to make a shard of it once totally finished.\n\nActually, it's my first project written in Crystal : feel free to contribute, or to send tips ! I'm doing it only to train myself.\n\nAnd don't hesitate to give a star if you like it, of course!\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  ftp:\n    github: LeChatErrant/ftp\n```\n\n2. Run `shards install`\n\n## Usage\n\n```crystal\nrequire \"ftp\"\n\nserver = Ftp::FTPServer.new(8000, \"/home\")\nserver.start\nsleep\n\n```\n\n## Run example\n\nYou can find an example of utilisation at the root of the repository\n\nTo try it, simply run `crystal build example.cr --release`\n\nThen you can execute it with `./example port root_directory`\n\nThis will run a FTP server, listening on the specified port and mounted on 'root_directory'\n\n## Documentation\n\nhttps://lechaterrant.github.io/ftp/\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [x] Simple server\n- [x] Handling multiple clients (one fiber per client)\n- [x] Basic commands (QUIT, NOOP, USER, PASS, UNKNOWN)\n- [x] Basic working directory commands (PWD, CWD, CDUP)\n- [x] DELE command\n- [ ] TYPE command\n- [x] HELP command\n- [x] Object oriented version\n- [ ] Configuration file in JSON or YAML\n- [x] Documentation\n- [ ] Specs\n- [x] ACTIV mode\n- [x] PASSIV mode\n- [x] Basic data transferts (LIST, RETR, STOR)\n- [ ] Other RFC959 compliant commands\n- [x] Making a shard of it\n- [ ] Testing concurrency of the server\n- [ ] Multiple simultaneous data transfert on the same user\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Fork it (<https://github.com/LeChatErrant/ftp/fork>)\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\n5. Create a new Pull Request\n\n## Contributors\n\n- [LeChatErrant](https://github.com/LeChatErrant) - creator and
